## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these Java solutions, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlvaroAlonso-0/LeetCode-Problems.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Now you're ready to explore and use the LeetCode solutions.

## Usage

Each LeetCode problem solution is organized into its own Java class file, named after the problem's title. For example, the solution for the problem "Two Sum" can be found in the `TwoSum.java` file.

You can navigate through the solutions and their corresponding explanations within each Java file. Additionally, you can run the code in your IDE to verify its correctness and experiment with different inputs.
